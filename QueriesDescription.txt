<COMPANY EXPLANATION>
*Maids.cc Overview*
Maids.cc is a UAE-based company specializing in providing domestic workers (maids) to clients. The company offers flexible services that allow clients to tailor their hiring contracts according to their needs, ensuring a high level of satisfaction and convenience.
*Service Overview*
The process begins when a client signs a CC contract with Maids.cc. This contract provides the client with the flexibility to change maids as many times as necessary. Once the client is satisfied with a particular maid, they can opt to switch to an MV contract, which is a long-term contract between the client and the domestic worker.
There are two types of CC contracts:
1. Live-in CC Contract: The maid lives full-time in the client’s residence, providing round-the-clock support.
2. Live-out CC Contract: The maid lives in her own accommodation but commutes to the client’s residence regularly to perform her duties.
*Contract Switching and Flexibility*
At any time, clients can switch between Live-in and Live-out arrangements based on their preferences and needs. Similarly, maids can also switch between these two types of employment as their circumstances or the client’s preferences change.
For example, a Live-in Cancellation can occur either because:
1. The maid has been returned to the company, where she will be reassigned to another client.
2. The maid has switched to a live-out position, meaning she will no longer live with the client but will still provide regular services.
In contrast, Live-out Cancellations might happen if a client decides to end the service entirely or return the maid for reassignment, or the maid switches back to a live-in arrangement.
*Hiring Process*
Maids.cc hires domestic workers from various nationalities, including Filipina, Ethiopian, African, and others. Upon hiring, maids can choose between live-in and live-out positions. These maids can be hired under different circumstances.
During their employment, maids can switch between live-in and live-out arrangements as needed. For example:
- Live-in Maids are often hired for clients requiring full-time residential help.
- Live-out Maids are hired for clients who only need part-time or non-residential services.
- Maids who were initially live-in may switch to live-out based on their or the client’s changing requirements, and vice versa.
Maids may also be terminated for various reasons.

*Contract ID vs. Housemaid ID*
It’s important to note that the Contract ID associated with client contracts is entirely different from the Housemaid ID, which refers to the unique ID assigned when a maid is hired. Occasionally, the same numeric ID may appear for both a contract and a maid, but this is purely coincidental and doesn’t imply any direct connection between the two. The IDs serve different purposes and track distinct entities: contracts and maids.
*CC Data Presentation and Interaction*
In the following section, we will present and interact with the CC data. This includes placements, cancellations, maid recruitment, and attritions, along with their detailed breakdowns. The data will allow us to analyze the operations and performance of the company in managing client contracts, maid hiring processes, and overall service delivery.
